*[Talk to Mom]-> IntroPart1

=== IntroPart1===
Dana: Mom! Look! God sent me a baby! 
Mom: ...Excuse me?
Dana: Her name is Kimmy!
Kimmy: ...

*[It looks like Mom has something to say...]  ->DanasMomCorrectsDana 
//breaks in the conversation
=DanasMomCorrectsDana

Mom: That… No, Dana. God did not send you a baby.
Dana: What do you mean…? You said God sends people babies sometimes! You told me that.
Mom: Well… nevermind what I said. It doesn’t apply to you. God isn’t about to send you a baby anytime soon, trust me.
Dana: What! Why? I wished for a baby, and he granted my wish. Isn’t it obvious?
Mom: Where did you find this little girl? Honey, where’s your house?
Kimmy: ...

*[Hm..Kimmy?] ->DivertsConvoToKimmy//breaks in the conversation
=DivertsConvoToKimmy

Mom: Kimmy, can you tell me where your parents are?
Kimmy: I can go home later if I want…
Dana: Well maybe God didn’t send her, but she came out of nowhere! Kimmy, you just… appeared, right? Where did you come from?
Kimmy: Ferry Street... I untied myself from the porch so I could go for a walk…
Dana: ...

*[Looks at Mom] -> TakeKimmyHome
=TakeKimmyHome

Mom: It’s ok dear, let’s go to your house Kimmy… you said it’s on Ferry Street? Your parents are probably worried.

*[Go to Kimmy's House!]->IntroPart2

===IntroPart2===

Dana: I’m sorry… I thought God sent me a baby and I got so excited…
Kimmy's Mom: Oh, don’t worry. Thank you for finding Kimmy and walking her home. What's your name, dear?

*[Dana introduces herself.] -> DanaIntroductiontoKimmysMom
=DanaIntroductiontoKimmysMom

Dana: I’m Dana…
Kimmy's Mom: I don’t know many kids as responsible as you, walking Kimmy all the way home. I hope you two can be friends. I know Kimmy could learn a lot from you.

*[Kimmy looks confused.] ->KimmyHasSomethingToSay
=KimmyHasSomethingToSay
Kimmy: My… friend?
Dana: Yes! I’d love to be friends, Kimmy. Can I come by and play with you tomorrow?
Kimmy's Mom: I’ve been looking for a babysitter, actually. Her grandma was helping with that before, but she… well, she can’t anymore. Kimmy’s normally alright in her harness on the porch, but she’s getting a little old for that… If you’d like to play with Kimmy tomorrow, I’d be happy to pay you a quarter to keep an eye on her.

*[Take the job!] -> DanaTakesJob
=DanaTakesJob
Dana: Wow! Yes, please! I’d love to!
Kimmy's Mom: My work schedule is a little… hectic. It’d be great to have you by in the morning.
Dana: I’ll be here first thing! Wow, I didn’t expect to land a job today. Thanks so much!
Mom: Well, that all sounds good to me. A summer job will be a nice way to keep busy. Now then, let’s leave this nice family to their dinner.
Dana: Ok. Bye bye Kimmy, and Mrs...?
Kimmy's Mom: Mrs. Munro. Again, thank you for giving Kimmy a hand. It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Navarro.
Mom: Likewise.
Kimmy: Bye bye.

=MorningKimmy
Dana: Mornin’ Kimmy! I’m here to babysit, like I promised! Is your mom around?
Kimmy: My mommy’s not inside. She left already.
Dana: Oh, ok… Um, well… Is there anything you’d like to do today, Kimmy?
Kimmy: No… I don’t know.

*[Ask about her friends?] -> TryOne
=TryOne
Dana: That’s ok, do you have a friend you’d like to visit?
Kimmy: No...

*[Ask if she wants to do something at home?] -> TryTwo
=TryTwo
Dana: Should we watch TV or something in your house?
Kimmy: We don’t have a TV. My dad is in there too, so we should go play somewhere else. He’s busy.

*[Ask if she wants to go play with the neighborhood kids?] -> TryThree
=TryThree
Dana: Ok then! Want to walk around and play some games with the other kids?
Kimmy: Other kids…?
Dana: You know, the neighborhood kids. Like Donna. Isn’t she your age? You’re both going to be in Kindergarten, right?
Kimmy: Oh, yeah… I don’t think Donna is my friend though, so she probably wouldn’t want to play...
Dana: Well, let’s go become her friend! There's lots of other kids around, too. Like Anthony. I know him from school.
Dana: Come on, let’s go!
Kimmy: ...!

Dean: Hey, Kid.
Dana: Hi, Dean. This is Kimmy. I’m babysitting her now.
Dean: Well lookit that, aren’t you all grown up. You gettin’ paid?
Kimmy: My mom pays Dana a quarter a day.
Dana: That’s right! I’m here to buy some things… I mean, I haven’t gotten paid yet. This is my first day. But I have some money saved up!
Dean: Hah, I wish I had that kinda discipline. I blew my budget on fabric last week.
+[Tell Dean what you're saving up for!] -> Explain
=Explain
Dana: I need to save up money. For college, you know! My mom would get so mad if I didn’t plan ahead.
Dean: Hah! Your mom’s got the right idea. I wish I’d saved up for college.
+[Ask Dean what he spent his money on?] -> AskDean
=AskDean
Dana: So what did you spend all your money on? Your sewing classes?
Dean: Nah, that’s over. I’m workin’ on some Halloween costumes for my cousins… and some new pants for myself. You know, gotta apply those skills somehow.
Kimmy: I didn’t know people made clothes!
Dean: They do, Kimmy, they do. I make sweaters, dresses, hats--you name it.
+[Suggest that Dean sells his clothes!] -> Suggest
=Suggest
Dana: You should sell your clothes at Jordan Marsh! That’s where I always find the nicest clothes.
Dean: Hah! That’s a long ways off for me. But maybe someday… anyways, what can I get for ya?
+[Don't buy anything] -> Leave
=Leave
Dana: Thanks, Dean!
Kimmy: Thank you Mr. Dean!
Dean: Bye bye girls. Have fun.

===AnthonyAndAmber===
Dana: Hey Anthony.
Anthony: Hi Dana. It’s so weird seeing you outside of school, haha.
Amber: I’m Amber!
Anthony: This is my little sister, Amber. Is that your sister, Dana? I didn’t know you had a little sister.
Dana: Oh, no… This is Kimmy. I’m her babysitter.
Anthony: Isn’t Kimmy the girl that Jim--
Amber: Anthony! I know you’re mad at Jimmy, but--
Anthony: I know, I know, nevermind.
+[Ask about the gossip!!!] -> Gossip
=Gossip
Dana: Uhhhh… what? What’s the gossip?
Amber: Nevermind! Hi Kimmy. I remember seeing you walk to school last year. Isn’t it a bit far to walk? You should ride a bike, at least.
Kimmy: Oh… I don’t know.
Anthony: Are you two headed somewhere? You should hang out with Amber and I.
Dana: Well, we’d like to play a game!
Anthony: We’d been playing games with Harold earlier… but maybe we could try something new? Amber’s kinda picky though--fair warning.
Amber: Am not!

===Donna===
Kimmy: Hi Donna.
Donna: What happened, Kimmy? Did you untie yourself from the porch again?
Kimmy: ...
+[Change the Subject] -> Interject
=Interject 
Dana: Hi Donna! I’m babysitting Kimmy now, so--
Donna: So you untied Kimmy from the porch? Better not let her parents catch you.
+[Don't take that from Donna! Defend yourself!] -> DefendYourself
=DefendYourself
Dana: First of all, I’m her babysitter. Second, she’s perfectly able to untie herself. She’s too old for that thing now, even her mom thinks so.
Donna: She should probably stay on her porch. We’re the same age, but my mom takes me everywhere so I won’t get lost. I bet Kimmy would get lost if she wandered too far.
+[Call Donna out!] -> DonnasMean
=DonnasMean
Dana: I don’t know about that. Anyways, I was just going to ask if you wanna play with us... but I feel like you're being mean to Kimmy.
Donna: Oh, no. I'm just being honest!
Dana: Ok... well, I hope you two can get along, since you're neighbors... want to play a game with us?
Donna: Well, I’m trying to avoid Harold so it’s probably good to look busy. He keeps trying to tell me that my ears look childish. He is so snobby.
Kimmy: I like your ears.
Donna: Oh, thanks. They’re new. Anyways, I wanna play a new game.

+[You don't have any games!] -> NoGames

===Harold===
Kimmy: Hi Harold, play a game with us.
Harold: You aren’t my boss.
Kimmy: You’re always asking me to play though…
Harold: Well, try asking nicer.
Kimmy: Please play with us?
+[Ask if they know each other?] -> AskHarold
=AskHarold
Dana: Do you two know each other?
Harold: I walk my dog by Kimmy’s house sometimes. He always stops to play with her--
Kimmy: Dogs are nice.
Harold: His name is Buster. Which is a good name.
Dana: That is a good name.
Harold: Donna, Janey and Linda said it was an ugly name. I’m so mad at them.
Kimmy: I think Buster is a cute name.
Harold: Thanks...
+[Ask Harold to play a game with you?] -> PlayHarold
=PlayHarold
Dana: Dogs aside--Harold, will you play with us?
Harold: Sure. But only if you think that Buster is a good name for a dog.
Dana: Buster is a good name for a dog. Ok, now will you play with us?
Harold: Ok, ok.

===Janey===
Dana: Hey Janey, how are you?
Janey: You know the Grenada movie theatre? I got a summer job there. I started last week.
Kimmy: Wow… my mom took me there once...
Janey: What did you see? I go to the movies a lot, so I bet I saw it too.
Kimmy: Oh… we saw the movie with the… Uh... the fairy godmother and the shoe…
Janey: Cinderella?
Kimmy: Yeah... and we saw Mary Poppins.
Janey: I saw that at The Grenada too. It was so great.
+[Ask where to find Janey at the movies] -> AskJaney
=AskJaney
Dana: If we go see a movie there, where would we find you?
Janey: I’m at the snack counter, but I’m too little to be a cashier. I’m helping make popcorn… just until I’m old enough to do something more serious.
Kimmy: I love popcorn!
Janey: Yeah, it’s pretty awesome to be at the snack counter. I love popcorn. I can have free soda whenever I want, too.
+[Tell Janey about your babysitting job!] -> Brag
=Brag
Dana: I also have a summer job! I’m babysitting Kimmy! I wasn’t planning on working, but I think it’s great.
Janey: My mom said a summer job is important. I didn’t want her to think I was lazy, and I love movies so I got my cousin to help me get the job. He sells tickets there.
+[This summer I won't be lazy.] -> NotLazy
=NotLazy
Dana: I’m glad I won’t be lazy this summer. I think I’m getting too old to be lazy. I mean, I’m going into the 5th grade.
Janey: Yeah, it’s more fun to be out with people who aren’t just teachers and classmates too. By the way, I’m not working today. Wanna play together?

Dana: Whatcha reading there, Jimmy? Looks neat.
Jimmy: M-my comic… Archie...

Jimmy: Yeah!
Kimmy: I’ve never read a comic before.
Jimmy: Y-you can borrow one of mine whenever you like, Kimmy! And then we can uh…
+[Thinks to herself "You can do it Jimmy!"] ->BelieveInJimmy
=BelieveInJimmy
Jimmy: We can talk about it and pick our--our favorite characters!
Dana: Wow! That’s so nice of you, Jimmy! Guess you have a new friend, Kimmy!
Kimmy: I think… that sounds fun...
Jimmy: A-anytime, anytime… um…
+[Ask Jimmy to play a game!] ->AskJimmytoPLay
=AskJimmytoPLay
Dana: Say, are you free to play a game with us, Jimmy? We’ll teach you something new!
Jimmy: I’m not very good at games… b-but, if Kimmy wants me to...
Dana: I’m teaching Kimmy games and helping her make friends this summer.
Jimmy: If you’re learning games, can I play games with you on the playground sometimes too, Kimmy? Once school starts?
Kimmy: ...Ok. I don’t play much at school but I will with you if you want.
Jimmy: What! Oh! Yes… yes please…

===Linda===
Kimmy: Hi Linda... I haven’t seen you in a while.
Linda: I went to visit my auntie right when school ended.
Dana: Hi, Linda. Do you know Kimmy?
Linda: We’re neighbors.
Kimmy: Did you go far away?
Linda: Auntie’s in Boston.
Kimmy: That sounds far...
+[Talk about the time you went to Boston] -> MyTriptoBoston
=MyTriptoBoston
Dana: It’s not so far. You can even ride your bike there. Sometimes my sisters and I go. We like to go explore all the clothes shops. Like Filene's.
Linda: I don’t really go shopping, unless it’s for stuffed animals.
Kimmy: Dana is babysitting me, so she can go shopping with the quarters my mom gives her!
Linda: Oh, having a job is good. When I’m a little older I want to get one at an animal shelter or something. I like playing with dogs.
Kimmy: I love dogs.
+[Ask Linda if she would like to play a game!] -> PlayWithLinda
=PlayWithLinda
Dana: We’re looking for people to play games with. Want to play a game with us, Linda?
Linda: I guess so. I was playing with Donna earlier, but I could play some more.

===Mom===
Mom: What’s wrong, Dana? Aren’t you supposed to be out with Kimmy?
Dana: Kimmy and I just wanted to stop by, mom.
Mom: Fine, well, I think you should be out getting some exercise.
Dana: We’re walking everywhere!
Mom: What about you, Kimmy? Is Dana treating you ok?
Kimmy: Yes… we’re trying to play and make friends with the neighborhood kids.
Mom: That’s good. It must be nice to be out of that harness. Did your mom have that on you because she was busy in the house?
Kimmy: My mom ties me to the banister when she’s working and Dad’s watching me. She says she doesn’t trust him to keep his eye out.
Mom: Ah, I see. Well, I’m glad Dana can help.
Mom: Anyways, I think I had something for you two…

Dana: Oh no! I’m sorry… I thought I had some stuff to play games with in my bag… but it looks like I ran out.

Mom: Have a nice evening.
+[Walk home] -> WalkHome

Dana: I’ll walk home with you, mom.
+[Talk about Kimmy's rope] -> RopeQ
=RopeQ
Dana: ...Mom, when I picked Kimmy up this morning, she had a rope tied around her. Is that… normal?
Mom: Oh, was she tied to the doorknob?
Dana: She was tied to the porch.
Mom: My mom used to tie me to the doorknob so she could focus on making dinner.
Mom: It’s a little old-fashioned.
Dana: Oh…
+[Weird but okay?] -> Weird
=Weird
Dana: You never tied me up, though?
Mom: ...well, I suppose I never worried about you running off.
Mom: My mom used to worry I’d get into trouble, so when I was Kimmy’s age she’d keep me hooked to the doorknob if there was no one to keep an eye on me.
Dana: Wow… that's kinda weird.
Mom: A harness is a cheap babysitter.
+[Sure...] ->MomsAWeirdo
=MomsAWeirdo
Dana: I guess so... well, I'm definitely a better babysitter than a harness.
Mom: Come on, let’s head home. I’m glad you have a job now. Keeping busy is good for a girl your age.
+[Worry] ->Worry
=Worry
Dana: I hope I can be a good babysitter. Kimmy is kind of quiet, so it’s hard to tell if she’s having fun.
Mom: You’ll do fine.
