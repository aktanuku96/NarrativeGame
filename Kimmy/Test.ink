Mom! Look! God sent me a baby!
...Excuse me?
Her name is Kimmy!

That… No, Dana. God did not send you a baby.
What do you mean…? You said God sends people babies sometimes! You told me that.
Well… nevermind what I said. It doesn’t apply to you. God isn’t about to send you a baby anytime soon, trust me.
What! Why? I wished for a baby, and he granted my wish. Isn’t it obvious?
...
*[Hm..Kimmy?] ->DivertsConvoToKimmy//breaks in the conversation

=DivertsConvoToKimmy
Kimmy, can you tell me where your parents are?
I can go home later if I want…
Well maybe God didn’t send her, but she came out of nowhere! Kimmy, you just… appeared, right? Where did you come from?
Ferry Street... I untied myself from the porch so I could go for a walk…
...//break in the conversation 
It’s ok dear, let’s go to your house Kimmy… you said it’s on Ferry Street? Your parents are probably worried.

===IntroPart2===

I’m sorry… I thought God sent me a baby and I got so excited…
Oh, don’t worry. Thank you for finding Kimmy and walking her home. What's your name, dear?
*[Dana introduces herself] -> DanaIntroductiontoKimmysMom
=DanaIntroductiontoKimmysMom
I’m Dana…
I don’t know many kids as responsible as you, walking Kimmy all the way home. I hope you two can be friends. I know Kimmy could learn a lot from you.
*[Kimmy looks confused] ->KimmyHasSomethingToSay
=KimmyHasSomethingToSay
My… friend?
Yes! I’d love to be friends, Kimmy. Can I come by and play with you tomorrow?
I’ve been looking for a babysitter, actually. Her grandma was helping with that before, but she… well, she can’t anymore.
Kimmy’s normally alright in her harness on the porch, but she’s getting a little old for that…
If you’d like to play with Kimmy tomorrow, I’d be happy to pay you a quarter to keep an eye on her.
*[Take the job!] -> DanaTakesJob
=DanaTakesJob
Wow! Yes, please! I’d love to!
My work schedule is a little… hectic. It’d be great to have you by in the morning.
I’ll be here first thing! Wow, I didn’t expect to land a job today. Thanks so much!
Well, that all sounds good to me. A summer job will be a nice way to keep busy. Now then, let’s leave this nice family to their dinner.
Ok. Bye bye Kimmy, and Mrs...?
Mrs. Munro. Again, thank you for giving Kimmy a hand. It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Navarro.
Likewise.
Bye bye.

=MorningKimmy
Mornin’ Kimmy! I’m here to babysit, like I promised! Is your mom around?
My mommy’s not inside. She left already.
Oh, ok… Um, well… Is there anything you’d like to do today, Kimmy?
No… I don’t know.
That’s ok, do you have a friend you’d like to visit?
No...
Should we watch TV or something in your house?
We don’t have a TV. My dad is in there too, so we should go play somewhere else. He’s busy.
Ok then! Want to walk around and play some games with the other kids?
Other kids…?
You know, the neighborhood kids. Like Donna. Isn’t she your age? You’re both going to be in Kindergarten, right?
Oh, yeah… I don’t think Donna is my friend though, so she probably wouldn’t want to play...
Well, let’s go become her friend! There's lots of other kids around, too. Like Anthony. I know him from school.
Come on, let’s go!
...!
