...Excuse me?
Her name is Kimmy!
...//breaks in the conversation
That… No, Dana. God did not send you a baby.
What do you mean…? You said God sends people babies sometimes! You told me that.
Well… nevermind what I said. It doesn’t apply to you. God isn’t about to send you a baby anytime soon, trust me.
What! Why? I wished for a baby, and he granted my wish. Isn’t it obvious?
...//breaks in the conversation
Kimmy, can you tell me where your parents are?
I can go home later if I want…
Well maybe God didn’t send her, but she came out of nowhere! Kimmy, you just… appeared, right? Where did you come from?
Ferry Street... I untied myself from the porch so I could go for a walk…
...//break int 
It’s ok dear, let’s go to your house Kimmy… you said it’s on Ferry Street? Your parents are probably worried.
